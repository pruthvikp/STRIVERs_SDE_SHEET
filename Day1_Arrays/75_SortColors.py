'''
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
 
Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

# Approach:
# Iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's.
# Overwrite array with the total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.

class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        count0,count1,count2=nums.count(0),nums.count(1),nums.count(2)
        nums[:]=[0]*count0+[1]*count1+[2]*count2
