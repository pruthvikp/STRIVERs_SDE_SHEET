'''
Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100

# The approach used in the code is known as the "Tortoise and Hare" method.
# This is a two-pointer technique where the `slow` pointer (the tortoise) moves one step at a time, and the `fast` pointer (the hare) moves two steps at a time.
# When the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the linked list, the `slow` pointer will be positioned at the middle node. 

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow=fast=head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow=slow.next
            fast=fast.next.next
        return slow
